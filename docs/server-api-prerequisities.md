# Server API prerequisities

`vue-admin-front` works with any server API supporting specification described [here](https://github.com/mrTimofey/vue-admin/blob/master/docs/swagger.yml).

Admin panel requires descriptions of all data models and action capabilities fetched from a server API. Data format is also described in the specification.

Web server must return HTML layout (`index.html`, generated by Webpack build) to any request path starting with a configured root (`/admin` by default) since the SPA leverages JavaScript History API.

## Supported API solutions

There is a list of ready-to-use solutions below. Refer to their documentation to setup and configure them.
